One of my favourite places was Musée d'Orsay, which was situated inside an old railway station. My favourite meal in Paris was breakfast where I had delicious coffee and pastries each morning.",

It is sometimes referred to as 'a city of citizens' with lots of diversity and great focus on the wellbeing of the many rather than the few. I loved walking through the public parks and along the canals that wind throughout the districts.",

Lac Léman (Lake Geneva) was crystal clear, and I cooled off during a mid afternoon run next to the 140m water jet known as Jet d'Eau. Rich cheese fondue and new friends made this a city I'll remember forever.",
